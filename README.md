# ROS2 with Clion

This repository is made for quick setup for the JetBrains Clion [ROS2 setup tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/ros2-tutorial.html).
It is prepared for the Ubuntu approach with the [ROS2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html).

Before executing make sure to personalize any paths especially in the 'cmake_commands.sh' file.
The first compilation must be performed manually:  
`colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -G Ninja`
